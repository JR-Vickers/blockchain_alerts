[Twitter Alerts Bot for Blockchain activity](https://replit.com/bounties/@anonymous-panda/twitter-alerts-bot-f)


Twitter bots are limited by twitter to suppress spam - the limit is 1500 tweets per month.  I've hardcoded this limit into the app so you don't have to worry about accidentally getting banned for spam.


You will need to provide the API keys; specifically, they are:

API_KEY
API_SECRET_KEY
ACCESS_TOKEN
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

All of these can be found on Twitter's website.  If you give me access to the Twitter account you want for the bot, I can find them for you.
